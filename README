NAME
    Plack::Middleware::File::Sass - Sass and SCSS support for all Plack
    frameworks

SYNOPSIS
      use Plack::App::File;
      use Plack::Builder;

      builder {
          mount "/stylesheets" => builder {
              enable "File::Sass";
              Plack::App::File->new(root => "./stylesheets");
          };
      };

      # Or with Middleware::Static
      enable "File::Sass", syntax => "scss", compass => 1;
      enable "Static", path => qr/\.css$/, root => "./static";

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::File::Sass is a Plack middleware component that works
    with Plack::App::File or Plack::Middleware::Static to compile Sass
    <http://sass-lang.com/> templates into CSS stylesheet in every request.

    When a request comes in for *.css* file, this middleware changes the
    internal path to *.sass* or *.scss*, depending on the configuration, in
    the same directory. If the Sass template is found, a new CSS stylesheet
    is built on memory and served to the browsers. Otherwise, it falls back
    to the original *.css* file in the directory.

    This middleware should be very handy for the development. While Sass to
    CSS rendering is reasonably fast, for the production environment you
    might want to precompile Sass templates to CSS files on disk and serves
    them with a real web server like nginx or lighttpd.

SASS BACKENDS
    If you have the sass gem version higher than 3 installed and have the
    "sass" executable available in your PATH, this module automatically uses
    the command to convert Sass or SCSS into CSS. If the command is not
    available and you have Text::Sass perl module available, it will be
    used. Otherwise you'll get an exception during the initialization of
    this middleware component.

OPTIONS
    syntax
        Defines which syntax to use. Valid values are *sass* and *scss*.
        Defaults to *sass*.
    compass
        Defines whether to use compass. True or false.
        Defaults to false.
